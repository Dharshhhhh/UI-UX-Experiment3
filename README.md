## Aim:
To apply Heuristic Evaluation of an Existing Website or App.

## Algorithm:
1. Start

2. Select the target app (Netflix)

3. Identify competitor apps or websites

4. Define heuristic evaluation principles

5. Evaluate Netflix based on each heuristic

6. Identify and record usability issues

7. Assign severity ratings to each issue

8. Compare findings with competitor apps

9. Suggest possible improvements

10. Document all observations and analysis

11. Conclude the evaluation

12. End

## Output:

### Heuristic Evaluation Report – Zomato

This report presents a heuristic evaluation of the Zomato application and compares it with two major competitors—Swiggy and Uber Eats.
The goal is to identify usability strengths and weaknesses and recommend improvements to enhance the overall user experience.

### 1. Objective

The objective of this heuristic evaluation is to analyze the Zomato app’s user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) using Jakob Nielsen’s 10 usability heuristics and compare it with competing food delivery platforms.
This helps in identifying usability gaps and proposing design changes to improve customer satisfaction and ease of use.

### 2. Competitors Selected

The evaluation compares Zomato with Swiggy and Uber Eats based on similar functionality, audience, and service offerings in the food delivery domain.

### 3. Methodology

A heuristic evaluation was conducted based on Nielsen’s 10 usability heuristics, focusing on aspects such as visibility of system status, consistency, user control, error prevention, and aesthetic design.
Each app was examined across its core user flow—searching for restaurants, adding items to the cart, and completing an order—to identify usability issues and design strengths.

### 4. Evaluation Criteria

The main heuristics considered in this study are:

Visibility of System Status

Consistency and Standards

User Control and Freedom

Error Prevention

Aesthetic and Minimalist Design

### 5. Heuristic Evaluation Summary

| Heuristic      | App 1: Swiggy | App 2: Zomato                 |
| -------------- | ------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Ease of Use    | Very easy     | Easy                          |
| Navigation     | Clear         | Sometimes crowded             |
| Visual Design  | Clean         | More colourful, slightly busy |
| Error Handling | Good          | Good                          |
| Speed          | Fast          | Fast                          |

### OUTPUT

After evaluating both apps using 5 basic heuristics, I found that Swiggy is cleaner and easier to navigate, while Zomato has a richer but slightly crowded interface. I recommend simplifying Zomato’s home page and improving Swiggy’s filter responsiveness

## Result:
Thus, the Heuristic Evaluation of an Existing Website or App is created and verified.
